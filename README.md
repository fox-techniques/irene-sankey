## Overview

**Irene-Sankey** offers an easy-to-use interface for creating Sankey diagrams, which are ideal for visualizing flow distributions across different categories or entities. The package is built to work seamlessly with pandas data structures and provides a range of customization options for colors, labels, and node arrangements, making it perfect for data analysts, data scientists, and anyone interested in visualizing complex flows.


## Features

- **Simple Sankey Diagrams**: Easily create source-target pair and customize Sankey diagrams from pandas DataFrames.
- **Customizable Styles**: Customize colors, labels, node spacing, and flow thickness to suit your needs.
- **Support for Large Diagrams**: Efficiently handles larger flows and multiple nodes.
- **Integrates with Pandas**: Easily map columns and rows from pandas DataFrames to nodes and links.


## Installation

Install **Irene-Sankey** using pip:

```bash
pip install irene_sankey
```

> **Note**: Requires Python 3.7 or above.


## Quick Start

Hereâ€™s a quick example to create a simple Sankey diagram with **Irene-Sankey**.

```python
import pandas as pd
from irene_sankey.core.traverse import traverse_sankey_flow
from irene_sankey.plots.sankey import plot_irene_sankey_diagram

# Sample data to test the functionality
df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "country": ["NL","NL","NL","DE","DE","FR","FR","FR","US","US","US"],
        "industry": [
            "Technology","Finance","Healthcare",
            "Automotive","Engineering",
            "Technology","Agriculture","Healthcare",
            "Manufacturing","Technology","Finance"],
        "field": [
            "Software","Banking","Pharmaceuticals",
            "Car Manufacturing","Mechanical Engineering",
            "Software","Crop Science","Medical Devices",
            "Electronics","AI & Robotics","Investment Banking"],
    }
)

# Generate source-target pair, node map and link for Sankey diagrams
flow_df, node_map, link = traverse_sankey_flow(df, ["", "country", "industry", "field"])

# Plot Sankey diagram 
fig = plot_irene_sankey_diagram(node_map, link)
fig.show()
```

## Usage

The core class in the **Irene-Sankey** package is `traverse_sankey_flow`. By passing a pandas DataFrame and selecting string columns in the order of the flow, you can quickly generate a required source-targer pair map to generate Sankey diagram.
