### Irene-Sankey Demo

Once the Irene-Sankey package is installed, you can use it in your projects. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use it: 

```py title="irene_sankey_demo.py" linenums="1"
import pandas as pd
from irene_sankey.core.traverse import traverse_sankey_flow
from irene_sankey.plots.sankey import plot_irene_sankey_diagram

# Sample data to test the functionality
df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "country": ["NL","NL","NL","DE","DE","FR","FR","FR","US","US","US"],
        "industry": [
            "Technology","Finance","Healthcare",
            "Automotive","Engineering",
            "Technology","Agriculture","Healthcare",
            "Manufacturing","Technology","Finance"],
        "field": [
            "Software","Banking","Pharmaceuticals",
            "Car Manufacturing","Mechanical Engineering",
            "Software","Crop Science","Medical Devices",
            "Electronics","AI & Robotics","Investment Banking"],
    }
)

# Generate source-target pair, node map and link for Sankey diagrams
flow_df, node_map, link = traverse_sankey_flow(df, ["", "country", "industry", "field"])

# Plot Sankey diagram 
fig = plot_irene_sankey_diagram(node_map, link, title = "Irene-Sankey Demo", node_config={
        "pad": 10,
        "line": dict(color="black", width=1),
    }
)
fig.show()
```
