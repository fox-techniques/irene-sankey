# üì• Installation 

## üì¶ pip 

IRENE-Sankey is published as a python package and can be installed with
`pip`, ideally by using a [virtual environment]. Open up a terminal and install with:

=== "Latest"

    ``` sh
    pip install irene-sankey
    ```

=== "1.x"

    ``` sh
    pip install irene-sankey=="1.*" # (1)!
    ```

    1.  IRENE-Sankey uses [semantic versioning].

        This will make sure that you don't accidentally [upgrade to the next
        major version], which may include breaking changes that silently corrupt
        your site. Additionally, you can use `pip freeze` to create a lockfile,
        so builds are reproducible at all times:

        ```
        pip freeze > requirements.txt
        ```

        Now, the lockfile can be used for installation:

        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

This will automatically install compatible versions of all dependencies:
[numpy], [pandas], [plotly], and [requests]. IRENE-Sankey always strives to support the latest versions, so there's no need to
install those packages separately.

    If you don't have prior experience with Python, we recommend reading
    [Using Python's pip to Manage Your Projects' Dependencies], which is a
    really good introduction on the mechanics of Python package management and
    helps you troubleshoot if you run into errors.
